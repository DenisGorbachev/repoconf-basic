# Repoconf Basic

This repository contains the basic configuration files for other repositories.

This repository has two branches:

* `main` contains the README.md and LICENSE
* `configs` contains the actual configuration files

The configs are on a separate branch to allow the child repositories to merge the `configs` without merging `main`.
